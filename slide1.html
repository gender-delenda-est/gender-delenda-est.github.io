<h2><u>What is K-Pop?</u></h2>

<p>
K-Pop emerged around 25 years ago in South Korea during a period of political and cultural liberalisation following the end of a sequence of repressive regimes and military dictatorships in 1987.
</p>

<p>
The end of censorship laws allowed the rise of new modes of media. Businesses in
the South Korean cultural industries set themselves up to produce and cater for 
a new market for western-style pop music. In particular, over the mid-90s, the 
original 'big 3' of the K-Pop industry
(<a href="https://www.smentertainment.com" >SM</a>, 
<a href="https://www.jype.com/Main.aspx?LDiv=EN">JYP</a>, &
<a href="https://www.ygfamily.com/index.asp?LANGDIV=E">YG</a>) were all founded.

<h2><u>Hallyu</u></h2>
<p>
The rise of K-Pop as an internationally successful commodity and mode/site of 
cultural practice is closely linked to the idea of 'Hallyu'--the Korean wave. 
After the 1997 economic crisis, the South Korean government priortised cultural 
industries as an area of recovery. Along with K-Drama, K-Pop became a 
nationally-important export.
