<h2><u>K-Pop Fandom</u></h2>
<p>
Fandom is an absolutely integral part of strategies for marketing K-Pop (see Lee,
2016). A heuristic has emerged in recent scholarship (e.g. Jin, 2016; Lee & Nornes
[Eds.], 2015) dividing Hallyu into "1.0" and "2.0" eras.
</p>
<p>
The transition between these is generally placed around 2008-2011, depending on the
author.
</p>
<h3>Hallyu 1.0</h3>
<p>
More dominated by K-Drama than K-pop, and mostly confined to East Asia. This period
saw less direct and concerted state intervention. Fans were generally older 
(30s-40s), and distribution mechanisms were generally older (e.g. terrestrial TV, radio). 
</p>
<h3>Hallyu 2.0</h3>
<p>
Marked by a younger, more international fanbase (in particular expansion to Europe
and the US), greater direct state intervention, and a move to newer digital methods
of distribution.
