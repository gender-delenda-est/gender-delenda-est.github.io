                  <h1>Why Make a Website?</h1>
                  <p>To begin with the obvious, making a personal website is a funny thing to do in 2022. Web 2.0 has pretty thoroughly dominated our idea of what the internet ecosystem looks like to the point that, for a lot of people my age, the most customisation & specificity we're used to is putting a fancy skin on your Tumblr blog.</p>
                  <p>I think this has been pretty detrimental for a number of reasons. First--and mainly--Web 2.0 is a entirely corporately-constructed project to enclose the commons of the internet. We can (and should) have serious discussions about the history of the internet within the military industrial complex, but it is undeniably true that the early- and pre-<abbr title="World Wide Web">WWW</abbr>internet was a far easier place in which to maintain an independent and non-hegemonised presence.</p>
                  <p>While there are larger problems--such as the ownership of <abbr title="the Domain Name System">DNS</abbr>--than merely our (and our data's) capture by a handful of megacorp platforms. Nevertheless, I think making more moves towards operating our own portions of cyberspace, whether it's a personal website or a <a href="https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/">Mastodon server</a> for you and your friends, presents and opportunity for us to develop the tools and capacities necessary to avoid complete capture of cyberspace by capital.</p>

                  <h1>Tools and Design Choices</h1>
                  <p>As is obvious fromt the URL, this site is currently hosted on the <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="github pages site">github pages</a> system, so I've avoided the need to do any real back-end work for now (although I might look into this in the future).</p>
                  <p>For my actual development process, the platforms I used are:</p>
                  <dl>
                     <dt>laptop</dt>
                     <dd>Acer, running Lubuntu (20.04)</dd>
                     <dt>IDE</dt>
                     <dd><a href="https://atom.io" title="Atom IDE">Atom</a></dd>
                     <dt>languages</dt>
                     <dd>HTML/CSS</dd>
                     <dt>image editor</dt>
                     <dd><a href="http://www.kolourpaint.org/" title="Kolourpaint">Kolourpaint</a></dd>

                  <div class="annotated">
                     <p>To what will, I'm sure, be the horror of markup fans everywhere I wrote pretty much everything here (barring long-form writing & some academic work) directly in <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>. Atom provides a pretty nice environment for doign this kind of work, and is, at least given the options available, a decent compromise between the invasive, over-featured garbage of most IDEs and the inconvenience of usig a plaintext editor like nano.</p>
                     <aside>
                        I'm not going to try and sell you on this workflow, which is probably pretty actively hostile to people who aren't already programmers. But I enjoy the crunchy/slightly old-skool feel.

                  <h3>Lightweight Design</h3>
                  <p>I've made a very deliberate decision to keep the site as much to <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> as possible, for two main reasons:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>modern web design is bad for people</li>
                     <li>modern web design is even worse for the environment</li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>By 'modern' web design I mean the kind of slick, JavaScript-heavy, image-laden website that has become ubiquitous in the last decade and a half. I describe this design as 'bad for people' because first because it is prone to failure. If you've ever accessed a website full of floating banners that seem to be in the wrong place or incomprehensible panel animations that lag out your browser, you know what I mean.</p>
                  <p>This kind of design usually serves only to make it harder to tell what you're actually doing or looking at on a web page, and more difficult to use essential, basic, and powerful web tools like saving images or copying text. While this is not univerally true--<abbr title="JavaScript">JS</abbr> does have some legitimate purposes--these extra features are normally just flourishes that don't add any actual utility or functionality to the website.</p>
                  <p>On a more personal level, I also believe the abstraction of the actual function and content of the website is a detriment to the user's experience. It should be reasonably easy to look at a web page, understand how it works, and potentially implment features of it for yourself. Designing for this kind of direct user interaction is also more accessible, as it creates fewer layers of obfuscation to be navigated by screenreaders and other accesibility tools.</p>
                  <div class="annotated">
                     <p>Modern 'heavyweight' web design is also bad for the environment. Running more processes & scripts, generating unnecessary <abbr title="HyperText Transfer Protocol">HTTP</abbr> requests for external resources, and transmitting high volumes of video/audio/images consumes far more energy than serving a simple <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> page that performs the same functions (providing information, links, etc).</p>
                     <aside>
                        Some bigger pages like that of design group <a href="https://formafantasma.com/website">Formafantasma</a> have been taking steps towards this kind of design which is, if belated, certainly welcome.
                     </aside>
               </div>
                  <p>I am, again, not against serving audio or video via web <i>per se</i>, but am against the completely unnecessary level of embedded streaming content that many sites now use. Putting a slick little video of your product on the front page of your website rather than a still image is a waste of everyone's time and resources.</p>

               <section>
                  <h1>Process</h1>
                  <p>I started working on this site by gradually hacking together the CSS styling. This was based on the design of a few old-style sites I like the aesthetic of (for example <a href="https://runyourown.social/">runyourown.social</a>).</p>
                  <p>I used a bit of the Sciences Po medialab <a href="https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/" title="iwanthue">i want hue</a> tool and my own judgement to choose the colourscheme.</p>
                  <p>I've set up with only two kinds of page layout, and have no intention to add more: one is a series of vertical panels (like this page) with optional sidebars, designed for longform text format. The other is a grid-based set of blocks design for pages for displaying short snippets; usually something like an index of writing.</p>
                  <p>If you've got a decent knowledge of <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>/<abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> the rest should be fairly obvious from the source code, which you can either inspect, or read <a href="https://github.com/gender-delenda-est/gender-delenda-est.github.io" title="site repo (github)">here</a>.</p>
